Zumo robot:

This was a smart system project where C programming was used to program a Pololu Zumo robot to complete a speed-run course and a zumo wrestling 
match. This project was done successfully and in this git repo there are project files that give an example of my codes, comments and structure
alongside the zumo documentation report that was written after this project.
The documentation is on pdf format.
The code is on C format, it can be read by common text readers and just in gitHub but Visual Studio or PSoC creator is recommended.

Here is a link to the robot.
