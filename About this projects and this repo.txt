Zumo robot:

This was a smart system project where C programming was used to program a Pololu Zumo robot to complete a speed-run course and a zumo wrestling 
match. This project was done successfully and in this git repo there are project files that give an example of my codes, comments and structure
alongside the zumo documentation report that was written after this project.
The documentation is on pdf format.
The code is on C format, it can be read by common text readers and just in gitHub but Visual Studio or PSoC creator is recommended.

Here is a link to the robot.

Games:

This is a project that was done in Unity. The plan was to make a stealth game with beat-matching movement plus a high score SQL database integration.
This project used SQL, Unity and C# programming.
All assets (game art, UI, textures and charactes) were made from scratch along with the music and SFX.
I have made a video of the game that is downloadable in the game folder.

Alongside the video I have put some sample C# code that is part of the game mechanics.
